My personal base for Javascript projects / apps
###

Gives you Backbone, testing with coffeescript specs for Jasmine,
common.js modules, stylus for css, and handlebars with swag helpers.

After messing with yeomon, brunch, sprockets (for
app modularity), I found this to be the best set up for me. It's just
grunt.js so changes can be made effortlessly.
